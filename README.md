# Near Express Stores 

- This project sticks to the marketplace theme but with a couple of new features, such as an account entitled to own a store, the owned store having products associated with it, and a CRUD modal implemented on these features. A section that accepts product suggestions from users but with certain restrictions on making suggestions pending on the number of current suggestions and when next there is a spot for making suggestions. And the ability for a store to be rated by users. a link to the demo [here](https://near-express-stores.vercel.app/).
